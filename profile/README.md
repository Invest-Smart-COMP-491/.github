## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The InvestSmart project is an ambitious financial platform that aims to provide investors with a comprehensive solution to track the market and news related to stocks and assets. The primary goal of the project is to empower investors with the ability to analyze and monitor a wide variety of stocks in real-time, by providing them with a single source of information about the market.
 
To achieve this goal, the project is designed as an InvestSmart product that will comprise a website and mobile application. The mobile app is the primary component of the platform, offering various features and functions that allow users to access and analyze market data, including market price, news, and expected price. Additionally, the mobile app also provides users with tools and resources to help them make informed investment decisions.
 
The website, on the other hand, serves as a promotional tool for the mobile app, and is designed to provide users with an overview of the platform's capabilities and features.
 
The project is an end-to-end software product development that includes the development of the front-end, back-end, database and server. The front-end is designed to provide a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for investors to access and interact with the platform's features and data. The back-end is responsible for managing requests from mobile applications and websites, as well as handling the asynchronous gathering of stock prices and news.  The database stores the data and makes it available to the back-end. The server-side also ensures that all processes are continuously active, rather than running solely on a local computer.

Overall, the goal of the InvestSmart project is to provide investors with a powerful and intuitive platform that makes it easy for them to track and analyze the market, and make informed investment decisions.
